# Hull-White model 
The code was written as a small experiment, calibrating the Hull White one factor model to a given zero curve. The Code follows the idea developed by Hull and White and implements an instance of type Trinomialtree modeling the short rate.<br>
The Model can then be used to value any cash flow, optionaly with any exercice date/value.
